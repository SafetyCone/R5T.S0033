R5T.S0033 - Generation, initial, parse, simple, for Roslyn syntax elements. Useful for quickly examining how syntax elements are parsed.

Mission: This script is *only* for simply parsing syntax elements, without contexts, without services, without annotations.

Allowed dependencies:

* R5T.B0006.X0002 - Generation, initial, parse, simple extensions to ISyntaxGenerator base.
* R5T.F0005 - Generation, initial, parse, simple, Roslyn syntax element functionality.

* R5T.S0032.F001 - Functionality to write syntax elements to an example code file.
